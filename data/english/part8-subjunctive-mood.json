Thunder Internet Service is proud of providing the best quality service to its customers. Therefore, we will settle this issue in a prompt manner.\n\nI have talked to the technical team, and they assume that some of your equipment must have suffered a mechanical malfunction. We would like to dispatch a technician to your home to check your equipment tomorrow. The technician you talked to will give you a call first thing tomorrow morning to schedule a visit. His phone number is (312) 667-2211. You can call him directly if you do not hear from him early tomorrow.\n\nSincerely,\nJane Davis",
